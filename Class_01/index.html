  <h1>NASA CUTS ISS LIVE FEED AS 'UFO' APPEARS</h1>
  <h2>They did it <a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/1765098/ufo-nasa-video-stream/" id="link">in the sixties </a>. And they're still doing it now. </h2>

<div class="bold"><p >A strange grey UFO has caused something of a stir in the conspiracy community after NASA caught the object on its ISS live feed camera and then promptly cut the lived feed as soon as it appeared.</p>

<p>The small, grey object is seen coming up over the horizon and then disappearing just moments later as NASA cuts the feed and switches to another of the cameras. </p>

</div>

<p class="bruce">The event took place on 15 January 2015 and will no doubt fuel conspiracy theorist's belief that NASA is deliberately hiding footage of potential UFOs.</p>

<div class="underline"> One of the simplest theories to this conundrum is that it's an artifact on the lens, or indeed the Moon. 'Streetcap1', the YouTuber responsible for the video doesn't hold with either though, posting a second video proving that it couldn't be the Moon.</div>

<p >The biggest mystery however is why NASA didn't just use duct tape to cover it up. That's what they did before, after all.</p>
